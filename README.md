# A tutorial on Survival Analysis in R 

Here I have shared code I have used throughout my Master thesis to analyze survival data from publicly available cancer patient data in TCGA (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). 

I have uploaded the main data files processed by me as well as scripts you can use to retrieve the survival associated between any gene of interest and a particular cancer type. 

Any questions? feel free to email me: karin[.]isaev[@]gmail[.]com
