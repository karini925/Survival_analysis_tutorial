# A tutorial on Survival Analysis in R 

Here I have shared code I have used throughout my Master thesis to analyze survival data from publicly available cancer patient datasets in TCGA (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). 

I am currently in the process of uploading all the required datafiles and scripts thus, this is a work in progress but expected to be fully complete by February 5th. In the meantime, I have also uploaded two Rmarkdown files and a set of slides I have previously presented on survival analysis. Hope you find this helpful! 

Any questions? feel free to email me: karin[.]isaev[@]gmail[.]com
